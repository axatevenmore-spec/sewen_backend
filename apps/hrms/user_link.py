"""The Administration user <-> HRMS employee link (db.md §2.2).

``users.employee_id`` is the only pointer between the two; a person has at most
one live login per employee record. The fields both screens show are kept in
step here: whichever side is saved through the API pushes the fields that
actually changed to the other side, so neither screen shows stale data and an
unchanged field never overwrites a newer value.

Shared fields, as ``(user attribute, employee attribute)``:

    name, email, phone, avatar     -- copied as-is
    joined_date  <-> joining_date
    department   <-> department    -- text on the user, a Department row on HRMS
    location     <-> location      -- text on the user, a Location row on HRMS
    reporting_manager <-> manager  -- each resolved through the other's link

Status is one-way: an employee who has left (Resigned / Terminated) loses their
login. Deactivating a login does not change the employee record -- HR decides
employment, Administration decides access.

Writes use ``QuerySet.update`` so a push never re-enters the other side's save
path, which is what keeps the sync from looping.
